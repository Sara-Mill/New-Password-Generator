This is a code I refractored in order to make prompts which accept user's input : length, and character type: numbers, symbols, lowercase, and uppercase.

UPDATE:  this code now functions as planned; generating and writing a random password generated based on user's input.

User decides criteria of characters to use, and length between 8 and 128.

The code accepts and validates user input. 

Thank you!
