This is a code I refractored in order to make prompts which accept user's input : length, and character type: numbers, symbols, lowercase, and uppercase.

The code accepts and validates user input, but does not display a random password on the screen.  Still needs work.

Feel free to reach out to collaborate.

Needs to write the password to the page, or have an alert with a newly generated password based on user's input.

Thank you!
